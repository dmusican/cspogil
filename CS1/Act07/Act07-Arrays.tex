Programs often need to store multiple values of the same type, such as a list of
phone numbers, or the names of your top 20 favorite songs. In the case of your
Arduinos, it might be multiple LEDs, or multiple frequencies and rests to play a
song.  Rather than create a separate variable for each one, we can store them
together using an array.
